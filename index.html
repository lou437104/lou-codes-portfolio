                <h3>SEN Education support</h3>
                <p>I have worked as a Learning Support Assistant in a SEN setting since leaving sixth form in july 2022, supporting students with a wide range of additional needs. Over time, this role has developed my communication, adaptability, and problem-solving skills in fast-paced and emotionally demanding environments. In addition to direct student support, I regularly troubleshoot day-to-day technical issues within my team and have taken initiative to design internal process improvements, including a tested ticketing system built with Microsoft Forms and Excel. This long-term role reflects my reliability, ability to grow within a position, and commitment to doing work thoughtfully and responsibly.
